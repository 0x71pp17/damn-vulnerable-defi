# Damn Vulnerable DeFi

Damn Vulnerable DeFi is _the_ smart contract security playground for developers, security researchers and educators.

Perhaps the most sophisticated vulnerable set of Solidity smart contracts ever witnessed, it features flashloans, price oracles, governance, NFTs, DEXs, lending pools, smart contract wallets, timelocks, vaults, meta-transactions, token distributions, upgradeability and more.

Use Damn Vulnerable DeFi to:

- Sharpen your auditing and bug-hunting skills.
- Learn how to detect, test and fix flaws in realistic scenarios to become a security-minded developer.
- Benchmark smart contract security tooling.
- Create educational content on smart contract security with articles, tutorials, talks, courses, workshops, trainings, CTFs, etc.
